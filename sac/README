* Overview
--------------------------------------------------------------
This README file is in the top directory (named sac) of a directory tree
that has either been installed from a SAC source distribution or
produced by the expansion of a SAC binary-distribution compressed tar file.
There are SAC binary-distributions for the following operating systems:

1. Sun Solaris: built on Solaris 2.9, but runs on 2.8 or 2.10.

2. Mac OS 10.6 and 10.7 (64 bit): will not run on 10.5 or earlier Mac OS.

3. Mac OS 10.4 and 10.5 intel

4. MAC OS 10.4 and 10.5 PPC

5. Linux 32-bit:  built on CentOS 5.7 (final): will run on Ubuntu 11.04 64 bit.

6. Linux 64-bit: built on CentOS release 5.7 (Final).

Optimization was not used in any of these builds. Because of licensing issues, 
there is no Cygwin binary distribution.  For more information on 
supported operating systems, see HISTORY and CHANGES in this directory.
It is assumed you have X windows on your system.  On Mac OS 10.7.2 or later,
you must have xcode installed.

* New features with this release
--------------------------------------------------------------
New features with this release are listed in the HISTORY file, and major
features are described in more detail in the CHANGES file and in the help
files, which can be accessed from within SAC or read online (HTML format) at URL
<http://www.iris.edu/software/sac/manual.html>.

As discussed in CHANGES, a feature new with v101.5 is the capability to save plots
in alternative file formats to SGF.  One of these formats is PNG, if the computer
that built SAC had libpng.  To maximize compatibility, the binary distributions of
SAC have been built using only the static library for libpng-1.2.44.

sac/aux/             contains files that are used by SAC during execution
                     On some Windows Cygwin installations, aux is renamed
                     winaux. (This depends on the version of Cygwin and how
                     SAC was built on those systems.)

sac/Editline.license License for Editline for Command line edits and history

* Environment Setup
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The system has to be able to find the binaries and scripts that are in
SACHOME/bin, and the environmental variable SACAUX must be set to SACHOME/aux. 
In addition, there are options within SAC that can be set through environmental
variables: e.g., the size of the crosshairs in ppk.  In SACHOME/bin there are
scripts that contain lines to do all these: sacinit.csh (csh and tcsh) and
sacinit.sh (bash).  If the distribution on your computer was built from
sources, these scripts were created during the installation of the SAC
package, so they should have the correct path for the distribution already in
them.  However, if yours is a binary distribution, you may need to edit the
directory given  for SACHOME. See the script for your shell for descriptions of
the options and the syntax for the commands.   

To set the path and other options for SAC, do the following:

  For csh and tcsh, edit ~/.cshrc adding the lines
        setenv SACHOME /usr/local/sac
        source ${SACHOME}/bin/sacinit.csh
    
     After saving and exiting the file, enter 
        source ~/.cshrc

  For bash, edit ~/.bashrc adding the lines
        export SACHOME=/usr/local/sac
        source ${SACHOME}/bin/sacinit.sh
    
    After saving and exiting the file, enter 
        source ~/.bashrc

If one wants to change any of the options, one makes the changes in the
appropriate initialization file in ${SACHOME}/bin. If more than one
person is using the same SAC distribution, it is probably best for each user
to copy the path and environment lines directly into his or her shell 
initialization file.

* Initialization file
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is recommended that each user create an initialization macro that runs 
whenever SAC is started.  To do this, one creates a startup macro file (e.g.,
/usr/local/macros/init.m) and aliases SAC as follows:

      alias sac '${SACHOME}/bin/sac /usr/local/macros/init.m'

Here is a sample initialization macro:

   lh columns 2 files none; qdp 10000 ; xdiv power off ; xlabel 'Seconds'
   setmacro /usr/local/macros ; transcript history file ./.sachist

For the meaning of these entries (lh, qdp, xdiv, xlabel, setmacro,
transcript), use the help feature in SAC.  For further discussion of the
transcript command and command-line editing, see SACHOME/utils/README_utils.

* Matlab Interface
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Solaris
  Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include matlab shared object libraries:
  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/matlab/extern/lib/sol2
- Mac OS X
  The DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH needs to be set
  setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
         ${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/Applications/MATLAB74/bin/maci

  These path may differ on your machine. The path needs to include
   - The Matlab Engine Library (libeng)
   - The Matlab Executable Library (libmex)

* If you need help ...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  If you have SAC working, use the help command from within SAC.  You can
    print hard-copies of the help files using printhelp.  HTML versions of the 
    help files can be found at URL <http://www.iris.edu/software/sac/manual.html>.
2.  Some features of SAC are described in the CHANGES file in this directory,
    and changes in new versions are summarized in HISTORY.
3.  URL <http://www.iris.edu/software/sac/> has links to other resources and
    information about updates.
4.  A place to share problems and find solutions is the sac-help mailing
    list: <sac-help@iris.washington.edu>.  You must be a subscriber
    to post to this listserv.  For further information, go to
    URL <http://www.iris.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/sac-help>.
    You do not have to be a subscriber to access the list archives.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
DO NOT DISTRIBUTE the SAC Software.  (That is what you agreed to when
you -- or whomever installed SAC on your system -- accepted the license 
agreement at the time the IRIS software request form was submitted.)
