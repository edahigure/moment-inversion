\fB\n+(CH.  Introduction\fR
.PP
The Standard Graphics Package (SGP) provides a simple, flexible, and almost
device independent graphics interface.  The package consists of two parts.
The first is a set of user-callable subroutines that are available in C and
Fortran.  These subroutines produce graphic commands that are defined by the
Intermediate Graphic Language (IGL).  This language is then interpreted by a set
of device filters.  In the UNIX environment the user program is usually
directly connected via a pipe line to the device filter.  The device drivers
provide some posterior scaling, translation, and page rotation options
to further modify the plot.
.PP
The SGP contains no provisions for interactive graphics.  This is done to
maintain the device its independent nature.  However, the basic plot
commands are intentionally identical to those found in a proposed
device specific Interative Graphics Package (IGP).

\fBDesign of the SGP\fR
.PP
At the core of the SGP is the concept of a generic plotting device.  This
device is capable of vector, raster, and color graphics.  Its pixel
resolution is 1000 dots per inch.  The inch is the basic unit of measure of
the user interface.  The (0,0) origin of the device is in the lower-left
corner and its maximum size in pixels is 32,767 (signed 16-bits) in the x
and y direction.  This means the plot surface (or page) is 32 x 32 inches.
Plot requests outside of this domain are clipped.  The device supports 256
independent colors that are set by 8-bit red-green-blue (rgb) look-up
tables.  This means a particular color is set by defining the 0-255
intensity levels on each of the red-green-blue guns in the table.
.PP
Any particular device attempts to mimic the generic device as best it can.  In
terms of resolution, it perserves the length of an inch.  For example, if
the user wishes to plot a line from (0.1, 0.0) to
(5.0, 0.0) (distances in inches), the user subroutines will translate this to a
line from (100,0) to (5000,0) on the generic device.  If the actual plot device
is a Versetec plotter with 200 dots/inch, the device filter will set the
line (20,0) $->$ (1000,0).  This has the effect of perseving the
length of an inch.  The specific device drivers make no attempt to map the
entire 32 x 32 inch page onto one plot.  The Versetec, for example, will
only (by default) plot a page that is 11 x 32 inches.  However, by repeating the
plot with a new ``view window'' specified, the remaining portions of the plot
page can be reproduced.  The user will have to tape the various sections
together to make an actual 32 by 32 inches plot.
.PP
It should be noted that perserving a length scale (inch) rather than mapping the
entire plot page onto a given device is the opposite philosphy of the Graphic
Kernel System (GKS).  I think that most scientific users will find the
perserving of a length scale to be preferable.
