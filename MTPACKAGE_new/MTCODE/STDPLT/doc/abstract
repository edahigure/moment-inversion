Abstract
.PP
The Standard Graphics Package (SGP) is a device-independent system for
non-interactive graphics.  It is intended to be used as a basis for higher level
graphics functions such as maps and 3D displays, and to stand alone.  The
package consists of a set of user callable routines for C and Fortran, an
intermediate graphics language, and a set of device-specific plot filters.
.PP
As far as the user is concerned the system provides simple scaling
and plot frame
facilities to render plots.  Parameters such as orientation of a page, size
etc. can be altered by parameters to the plot filters.
