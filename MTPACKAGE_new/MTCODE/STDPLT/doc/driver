\fBAdding A New Device Driver\fR
.PP
The SGP is designed to allow new drivers to be added to the system.  In some
cases this may be trivial if the new device looks like a previously coded one,
or it may be difficult if it is a bizarre device.
.PP
Fortunately, the base level driver for a given device can be pretty stupid, so
a simple working version can be programmed fairly quickly.  Further
modifications can then be gradually added to take advantage of special
hardware features.
.PP
Most of the complexity of the device drivers is collected together in the
directory \fIdevs/com\fR.  These routines read the IGL commands, get the
standard run time parameters (i.e. sending and page rotation), take care of
dashed and fatten lines, window the plots, and performs several other
functions.
.PP
To implement a new driver, a set of primatives needs to be coded.  These should
be placed in a directory named for the device, along with a \fIdevpar.h\fR
file, and a \fImakefile\fR.
The file \fIdevpar.h\fR contains the physical attributes
of the device (i.e. size and resolution), and it is a useful place to put
other device specific constants.  See \fIdevs/dum/devpar.h\fR for a prototype.
The \fImakefile\fR controls which routines are used from the common set,
the dummy set, and the device-specific set.
See \fIdevs/ver/makefile\fR for an example.
The dummy routines are null operators and can be used if a particular primative
cannot be implemented (i.e. setcolor on a B/W device.  They reside in 
\fIdevs/dum\fR.
.PP
A (hopefully complete) listing of the privatives are:
.in 1.4i
.ti -1.0i
\fIopendev()\fR	Open device.  Called once before the start
of the plotting.  This is often a dummy for
drivers which do not want to open the device
until the plot is ready.
.ti -1.0i
\fIclosedev()\u*\d\fR	Close device.  Called once after the last plot.
.ti -1.0i
\fInewplot()\u*\d\fR	Start new plot.  Called before each plot.
At a minimum it resets the pen back to (0,0).
.ti -1.0i
\fIsendplot(more)\u*\d\fR Send the plot to the device.  Called when the
plot is ready.  The argument indicates whether
more plots are coming.
.ti -1.0i
\fIvector(x1, y1, x2, y2)\u*\d\fR  Draw a line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2)
where the units are device pixels.  Dashes,
fattening, windowing, and color are already taken
care of.  The routine needs to implement (or ignore)
various \fIpenmode\fR types.
.ti -1.0i
\fIlinefill(y1, y2)\u*\d\fR  Fill scan line (x1, y1) to (x1, y2) according
to pattern \fIbrushpat\fR for BW devices or color otherwise.
The color is already selected.
.ti -1.0i
\fIdefcolor(icol,ired,igreen,iblue)\fR  Define in hardware the color table
entry icol as the triplet \fI(ired, igreen, iblue\fR).
.ti -1.0i
\fIsetcolor(icol)\fR  Set current color to \fIicol\fR.

\u*\d  Not called by user. Called by driver program.
