This device driver leaves the graphics terminal in a messed up state
upon exiting.  You must fix it with rasfix, which resets the terminal.
(Can also fix it by powering down, or by entering graphics mode manually
and typing MODDIS)


Compile rasfix.c separately by typing 

	% cc -o rasfix rasfix.c

rasfix will reset the rastertech graphics terminal.


-----------------------------------------------------------


There are 2 different versions of open_close.c .  
open_close.c is the normal one, and leaves the graphics terminal
in a messed up state.

open_close1.c will reset the graphics terminal , but
can only be used if two terminals are available.
