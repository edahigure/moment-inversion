  Igltool is really not finished.

1) endplot (newplot) doesn't work.  Igltool should have a menu entry that
   becomes active if another plot awaits after endplot.  This entry should
   be inactive otherwise.  sendplot(), not closedev(), should start
   window_main_loop().

2) penmode currently does nothing.  I didn't know it existed.  xvector.c
   will address this.  Also, FILL_BRWHITE for polygons needs fixing,
   see xpolygon.c.  Finally, why aren't the same fill options available
   for both pens and brushes?  This is an IGL bug.

3) zoom would be nice, but I doubt it will ever happen.

4) sticky mouse could be sped up.  Try moving the canvas, but not by
   scrolling with the scrollbars.  The canvas can be moved in one operation
   in an arbitrary direction.  Scrolling takes two (one in x, one in y).

5) cross-hairs to return canvas coords in "inches"?

6) allow a grid to pop up (menu item), and be erased.

7) color edit facility (on bw, this would merely invert)
