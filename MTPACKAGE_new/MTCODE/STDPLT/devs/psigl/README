Fixes by GHM 12/88

	1)  I changed the bit field width of the vertical and horizontal
	character centering flags.  The fields were each 2 bits, however
	stdplt appears to use 4 bit fields.  This fix appears near line
	58 of text.c

	2)  The font sizes were in units of points, however the stdplt
	usage is in terms of inches.  This fix appears near line
	290 of compile.c

Bugs remaining:
	The fill patterns have seams.  This is apparently a recurring
	problem, as it is mentioned in the original comments.  Perhaps
	the parameters are printer-dependent?
	See comment at line 127 in cgen.c

Dave:  If you make any improvements, please let me know what they
are so I can keep our version up to date.  Thanks, greg@expet | greg&dix

PS:  Sorry it took me so long to transfer these files.  The net between
our machines was down all day yesterday so I couldn't ftp the files.
I tried to phone you but I couldn't locate you.
