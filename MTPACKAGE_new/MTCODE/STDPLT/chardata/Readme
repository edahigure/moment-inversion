# chardata/Readme:  Richard Stead 3-20-89

   This directory contains the Hershey font set, rearranged for use by
IGL filters.  The Hershey font set represented here is not complete,
but what is missing is not essential.  The missing data are:  the
'cartographic' (9 point grid) fonts, the 'indexical' (13 point grid) fonts,
the symbols and large characters (various grids) and a few characters
from the cyrillic font and the math font.  The basic Hershey fonts are
on a 21 point grid.  Each Hershey font has 82 characters.  This contrasts
with the 94 printing characters of ascii (I am not counting white space
characters).  The following list shows the contrast:

		In Hershey Fonts: (84)
	ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789.,:;!
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz?'"*/()-+=%&@$#

		On average keyboard: (94 printing chars of ascii)
	ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789.,:;!
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz?'"*/()-+=%&@$#
		... and ...
	<>[]{}`~|\^_

		In Hershey Math:
	<>[]{}|

		Create by drawing backwards (or other simple rule):
	`\_

		Remaining:
	~^

Some of the missing ascii characters are available from the math font,
some ('\) can be made by reversing characters, the _ is a simple rule.
For ^, I substituted the up arrow from the math font, I drew ~ myself.
If someone complains, change them.
   These extra characters are added to the fonts from the file named
'additional'.  additional also contains # and %, since many fonts did
not specify these.  Thus all fonts contain the same set of additional
characters to give them the full complement of 94.  The makefile adds
'additional' when required, compiles char_compile.c and then runs it
for 12 fonts.  (The shell script do_compiles is needed for this).
Some of the fonts are duplicates, some are not used.
The result, after make is done, is a file chardata.h to be included
in text.c during compilation.  'make clean' removes this file.
   One more note:  newmath.ascii is my compilation of math + greek.
Most of the characters are labeled for identification.  Plenty of
room is left here for more math symbols (for instance, those of the
Hershey fonts that we seem to be missing, or useful ones like del).
