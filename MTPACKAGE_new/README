The reporting of seismic moment tensor solutions obtained
using this software on the WWW and in the technical literature should include
the following acknowledgement statement. "Moment tensors were computed using
the tdmt_invc package developed by Douglas Dreger of the Berkeley Seismological
Laboratory, and Green's functions were computed using the FKRPROG software
developed by Chandan Saikia with URS."
